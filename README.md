# WooCommerce-Lottery
WooCommerce Lottery with add to cart whilst not logged in

The only file really modified for this is /public/class-wc-lottery-public.php

swapping this file out will enable adding tickets/numbers to cart without the need for the customer to login and allows them to use the checkout as normal.

Any support requests, please Email info@spirehosting.co.uk
